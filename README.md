# Summary 
This was my first project  for Skillcrush boot-camp on how to create a static  website. This was more of a simple project that I had to complete focusing on replicating what I would see
if I were to download a pdf layout from a company and/or company and make it come to life on the web. There isn't much special effects nor are there multiple pages. The focus was create
a one page resume layout. This looks more of a resume like website but this was
a starting of what was to come in future projects on this online boot-camp. 

### Description/ walk-through
At first glance the image takes up the most part of the layout. As you can see the navigation is over the photo itself. Also, you will see the intro
header in two different colors. In the next section is a description about Julibee Austin, which I had to use flexbox to create to separate columns.
The third section showcases her knowledge and skills as a web designer; and last is how to contact her.


#### Software used:
Adobe Dreamweaver (text-editor)

#### What I learn:
Since I had past experience on the basics of HTML and CSS, that was more of a breeze. But, the challenge was fusing flexbox and media queries in order 
to create three different layouts to be cohesive tothe device used 

##### Challenges to improve on
1. Flexbox is a challenge which I need to work on more.
2. Margins and Paddings


##### Solutions/solving the issue:
The first time I did this project it took me an entire month to understand new concepts to create a more advance layout. Even then, there were so many errors with 
how I coded this site that I had to start over again and see what went wrong. Honestly, I am glad that this happen so that I know what not to do for
future projects. But, once I completed this project, which took me less than three weeks to complete, on second try. I was so proud of myself.

1. Try to keep widths 100%

2. Use margins and paddings with ems and rems NOT pxs.
