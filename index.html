		  <h3>A little bit about me.</h3>		
		
		<div class="half-width">
	    <p>I've made my home base in Provience, Rhode island, with myy small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
			</div>
				
		<div class="half-width">	
		<p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I really found out something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

			<h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
